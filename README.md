# Comp2D
A 2D Game Engine written in C++, using SDL2 and Box2D

Comp2D is a 2D Game Engine I made with the purpose of understanding how Game Engines worked. It was originally called MeOWN Engine, and the first version of the engine was finished on June 2018. On October 2019, I decided to change the engine's name to Comp2D and publish it on this repository.

You can use Comp2D to create your own games/softwares, as long as you follow the terms on the zlib license for both the Comp2D and Box2D code.

For more information on the engine and how to use it, check out the website: Under Construction
